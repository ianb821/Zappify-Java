Zappify - A sample application using the Zappos API


About
============

Zappify is a sample app that I wrote as a challenge for Zappos.  It makes use of their Search, Product, and CoreValue APIs.  You are able to search for items from Zappos.com and have the displayed along with important information about it.  You can then enter you email address to be notified when the item is at least 20% off.  It will check every hour for updated pricing.
